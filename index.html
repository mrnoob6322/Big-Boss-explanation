        <h1 class="title">Big Boss(naked snake) was the apprentice of the legendary soldier, "the boss" they lived and died on the battlefield together, until the government launched "operation snake eater" which meant to assasinate the boss and kill the cobras for defecting to  the Soviet union and launching a Nuke. Naked snake finished the mission, eliminating "the cobras" and "the boss," thus, granting him the name "Big Boss".</h1>
